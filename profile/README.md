# UNL Aerospace eXperimental Payloads team
AXP is a team of university students who do science in space and the upper atmosphere. 
This year we are creating a payload which will literally go to space (150km altitude) on a steep suborbital trajectory. 
We plan to study how atomic oxygen at the edge of space can degrade electrical components. 
Additionally, we are sending up radio transmitters to study radio wave propagation at different altitudes. 
We hope to drive community engagement by inviting ham radio enthusiasts to make contact with our payload during the flight. 
During the school year, we plan to test our designs with high altitude balloon launches out of Innovation Campus.

> The goal of this scientific mission is to characterize the performance and degradation of experimental perovskite solar cells from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory while in low earth orbit.
> To accomplish this, a custom precision curve tracer was designed along with a low-Ohm analog multiplexer that was integrated with Near Space Launch's 1U FastBus CubeSat Platform, which incorporates an electrical power system and Iridium satellite communication system for telemetry.

> Big Red Sat-1 was integrated into the Nanoracks CubeSat Deployer 27 (NRCSD27) on 12 December 2023 and launched on 21 March 2024 on the SpaceX CRS-30 mission.
> Big Red Sat-1 was deployed from NRCSD27 by Voyager Space on 18 April 2024 at 18:05:09 UTC (Deployment Clip).
> The satellite made first communication with the operations team at 03:00:10 UTC on 19 April 2024.  
> The satellite deorbited sometime after 23:41:51 UTC on 1 August 2024 after 105 days of operation.
